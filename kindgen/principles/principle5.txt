**"Safe to Fall"** principle:

- **Failure as a learning tool**: Encourage students to view failure as a normal part of the learning process, rather than something negative.
- **Foster experimentation**: Promote risk-taking and learning innovation in the classroom, allowing students to try new approaches without fear of judgment.
- **Non-judgmental environment**: Create a supportive atmosphere where mistakes are not criticized, but seen as opportunities to learn and improve.
- **Frequent low-stakes testing**: Use low-stakes, self-administered, or fun tests to reduce the fear of failure, allowing students to see where they need improvement without pressure.
- **Celebrate resilience**: Focus on studentsâ€™ ability to bounce back after mistakes, emphasizing persistence and effort over perfection.
- **Feedback from failure**: Teach students to use their mistakes as valuable feedback for growth and learning strategies.
- **Positive culture of learning**: Build a classroom culture where failure is embraced as part of progress, encouraging curiosity and resilience in students.

This approach aims to build confidence, reduce fear, and enhance students' willingness to engage and take risks in their learning.
