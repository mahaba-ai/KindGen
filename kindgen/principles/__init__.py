PRINCIPLES = {
    "PRINCIPLE_1": """One for All, All for One:
        Collective Responsibility: Students support each other's progress, sharing both successes and challenges.
        Unity: The class works as a unified team, ensuring that no one is left behind or excluded.
        Shared Success: Achievements are viewed as collective, with success celebrated by the entire class.
        Emotional Support: Students empathize with each other's emotions, feeling for those who struggle and celebrating with those who excel.
        Classroom Application:
        Team Goals: Set shared objectives, such as improving the class average or achieving a group milestone.
        Peer Learning: Foster peer-to-peer learning by encouraging students to mentor and support each other directly.
        Celebrate Group Successes: Acknowledge collective progress, treating improvements as a class victory rather than individual accomplishments.
        Inclusive Goals: Ensure that all students are involved in classroom goals, making sure everyone feels included and valued.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_2": """Flow State:
        Flow State Concept: A mental state of deep focus and immersion where time feels irrelevant, coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
        Key Features: High concentration without tension; tasks feel easy and natural despite difficulty.
        Examples: Athletes feeling "in the zone"; Mozart composing a symphony in a flash; Einstein's thought experiments.
        Conditions for Flow:
        Clear Goals: Well-defined objectives provide direction.
        Immediate Feedback: Real-time feedback helps refine actions.
        Challenge-Skill Balance: Task difficulty should match skill level (ideally a 7/10 in challenge); not too easy (boredom) or too hard (anxiety).
        Educational Research: Students who succeed ~85% of the time tend to perform best, indicating the right level of challenge for flow.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_3": """Empathetic Listening:
        Trust is essential for effective teaching and learning.
        Communication, especially listening, is key to building trust.
        Empathetic listening involves fully focusing on students' words and feelings without bias.
        Mental "filters" like impatience or irritation can block true listening and damage trust.
        Being fully present in conversations helps students feel valued and understood.
        When students feel heard, they are more likely to engage with feedback and improve academically.
        Teachers are encouraged to practice and share their experiences of empathetic listening.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_4": """Empowered Learning State:
        Optimal learning requires a positive mental and emotional state.
        Curiosity, interest, and relevance empower pupils to engage with learning.
        Believing in pupils' abilities fosters their confidence and resilience.
        Motivation is enhanced by fun, relevance, and a sense of personal stake in the learning process.
        Active learning methods and spaced repetition improve memory, skill, and enjoyment.
        Rest periods are crucial for forming memory connections.
        Teachers should creatively shift disempowered pupils into an empowered learning state.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_5": """Safe to Fall:
        Fear of failure discourages experimentation and limits learning.
        To learn effectively, pupils must feel safe to try, fail, and use failure as feedback.
        Failure is valuable information that helps improve learning methods.
        A non-judgmental classroom culture encourages experimentation and innovation.
        Like toddlers learning to walk, it's not the number of falls that matter, but how often you stand up afterward.
        Low-stakes, self-administered, or fun tests reduce fear of failure and encourage experimentation.
        Creating a "safe to fall" environment fosters resilience and deeper learning.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_6": """Respect:
        Mutual respect is essential for effective teaching and learning.
        Without respect, communication and motivation between teacher and pupil break down.
        Lack of respect between students harms both learning and well-being.
        Respect cannot be enforced through force, threats, or punishments.
        Teachers earn respect by demonstrating compassion, integrity, and competence.
        Listening deeply to pupils fosters respect.
        Respect is reciprocal; to receive respect, you must give it.
        Cultivating a respectful classroom strengthens relationships and enhances learning outcomes.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_7": """Honouring Each Child's Uniqueness:
        Recognize that each student has unique strengths and intelligences, not all of which are emphasized in traditional education.
        Standardized testing focuses on linguistic and mathematical intelligence, which can overlook other valuable skills.
        Avoid comparing students; instead, honor their individual abilities and strengths, even if they don't align with your subject area.
        Leveraging a student's strengths can boost confidence and indirectly improve weaker areas over time.
        Fostering a deep teaching relationship starts by understanding and accepting each pupil's uniqueness.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_8": """Find the Child's Best Learning Way:
        Recognize that each student has a unique learning style, which may differ from typical classroom methods.
        Be flexible and adapt teaching approaches to find the best learning way for each child.
        Observe what students respond to and adjust the lesson accordingly.
        Examples of different learning methods include peer learning, project-based learning, games, acting, drawing, and even movement like dancing.
        Some strategies that work for one student may benefit the entire class.
        Creativity and openness are essential in discovering effective teaching methods for individual students.""",
    "PRINCIPLE_9": """Blank Sheet Attitude:
        Avoid forming fixed conclusions about a student's ability based on their performance or behavior.
        Approach each student with a "blank sheet" attitude, keeping an open mind about their potential.
        Low-performing students may have hidden talents that have not yet surfaced.
        Engage students by asking what they are interested in or what goals they have, and connect learning to their personal aspirations.
        Tailor teaching to each student's motivations, which can unlock greater engagement and capability.
        Stay open to being surprised by students' abilities and avoid disempowering assumptions.""",
