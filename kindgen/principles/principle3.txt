Trust is essential for effective teaching and learning.
Communication, especially listening, is key to building trust.
Empathetic listening involves fully focusing on studentsâ€™ words and feelings without bias.
Mental "filters" like impatience or irritation can block true listening and damage trust.
Being fully present in conversations helps students feel valued and understood.
When students feel heard, they are more likely to engage with feedback and improve academically.
Teachers are encouraged to practice and share their experiences of empathetic listening.
