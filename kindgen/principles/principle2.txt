Flow State Concept: A mental state of deep focus and immersion where time feels irrelevant, coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
Key Features: High concentration without tension; tasks feel easy and natural despite difficulty.
Examples: Athletes feeling "in the zone"; Mozart composing a symphony in a flash; Einsteinâ€™s thought experiments.
Conditions for Flow:
Clear Goals: Well-defined objectives provide direction.
Immediate Feedback: Real-time feedback helps refine actions.
Challenge-Skill Balance: Task difficulty should match skill level (ideally a 7/10 in challenge); not too easy (boredom) or too hard (anxiety).
Educational Research: Students who succeed ~85% of the time tend to perform best, indicating the right level of challenge for flow.
