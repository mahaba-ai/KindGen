Avoid forming fixed conclusions about a student's ability based on their performance or behavior.
Approach each student with a "blank sheet" attitude, keeping an open mind about their potential.
Low-performing students may have hidden talents that have not yet surfaced.
Engage students by asking what they are interested in or what goals they have, and connect learning to their personal aspirations.
Tailor teaching to each studentâ€™s motivations, which can unlock greater engagement and capability.
Stay open to being surprised by students' abilities and avoid disempowering assumptions.
