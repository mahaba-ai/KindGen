Recognize that each student has unique strengths and intelligences, not all of which are emphasized in traditional education.
Standardized testing focuses on linguistic and mathematical intelligence, which can overlook other valuable skills.
Avoid comparing students; instead, honor their individual abilities and strengths, even if they don’t align with your subject area.
Leveraging a student’s strengths can boost confidence and indirectly improve weaker areas over time.
Fostering a deep teaching relationship starts by understanding and accepting each pupil’s uniqueness.
