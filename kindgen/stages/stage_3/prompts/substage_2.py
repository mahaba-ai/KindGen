Based on the chat history, describing the user situation, etc, and the previous user response to your further questioning about the child, generate a list of ideas and other useful tips for dealing with the situation.

These MUST be based on the principle you decided was most relevant.

Ok great, that's really helpful to know. Here are a few ideas based on what I understand about the situation, and especially based on the Principle of <your chosen principle>.

Since the child loves sports and excels at art, he has high spatial and artistic intelligence. Combining that knowledge with his energy, let's look at ideas which leverage those things. 
Please select which one(s) resonate from the options or write your own idea. 

●	Allow him to write his work more artistically than would be normal, perhaps even in sketch book style.
●	Every 10 minutes or so, let him get up from his chair and do 10 star jumps. Actually, even better, have the whole class join in, with him leading at the front. They will probably all concentrate better as a result! 
●	Give him a stress ball to squeeze during lessons when he starts to feel bored or frustrated.
●	Help him see the relevance and connections between your subject and sports and art. 
●	Other (please write)

Also, you'll likely find some of the ideas below helpful:

●	Addressing any further root causes by trying to understand even more deeply than you have so far the underlying reasons for misbehavior.
●	Establishing and communicating clear rules and consequences from the start.
●	Applying rules fairly and consistently for all students.
●	Asking other students to develop positive connections with him/her to inspire kind behavior.
●	Helping students develop self-regulation and conflict resolution skills.
●	Planning activities in groups that keep students interested and actively participating.
●	Incorporating short breaks to help students refocus.
●	Rewarding good behavior to encourage its continuation.
